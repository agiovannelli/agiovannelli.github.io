                <p>
                    Welcome! My name is Alexander Giovannelli and I am a fourth-year Computer Science Ph.D. student at Virginia Tech. 
                    I am a member of the <a href="https://wordpress.cs.vt.edu/3digroup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">3D Interaction Group</a> directed by <a href="https://wordpress.cs.vt.edu/3digroup/author/dbowman/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr. Doug A. Bowman</a>, as well as a member of the <a href="https://hci.icat.vt.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Center for Human-Computer Interaction</a>. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Prior to attending Virginia Tech, I received my Bachelor's of Science with honors in Computer Engineering with German Studies and Computer Science minors from the University of Cincinnati in 2018. 
                    As part of my education at the University of Cincinnati, I completed five semesters of <a href="https://ceas.uc.edu/real-world-learning/co-op.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cooperative education experiences (co-op)</a>, including two semesters abroad in Germany as an <a href="https://www.uc.edu/campus-life/careereducation/get-experience/international/co-op.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">international co-op</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My research interest lies in the intersections of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Extended Reality (XR), and 3D Interaction (3DI).
                    I am currently developing and evaluating systems that facilitate both real-time, synchronous collaboration for simultaneous user cooperation, as well as recording and playback functionalities to support asynchronous collaboration over different time periods.
                </p>
